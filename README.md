# US Elections 2016 Primaries

### Overview

[US_Election_Nevada_Analysis][id1] focuses on the results of the US elections' primaries in Nevada. The Republican candidate Donald Trump highlighted that his victory with 46% in Nevada was supported by Hispanics/Lationos. There were different political analysis about what nevada showed about Trump's Hispanic support and what it did not. 

The analysis starts with a look into the top-three Republican candidates' results in the four given states, then it zooms in to look into Nevada, and finally digs deeper into the results of an interesting county in Nevada that gave extreme values.

The following questions are addressed:

* Can we find a correlation between the percentage of hispanics in Nevada's counties and the number of votes given to Donald Trump? Can we see other trends in the rest of the states?

* Is there something special that we can spot about the counties that gave Trump the highest votes in Nevada?

* What about the trends with the other Republican candidates?
